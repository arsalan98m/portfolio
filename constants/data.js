      `I've been developing front end web application since I was 1.5 years old. I didn't know what software development meant at that time because the term was not coined back then.`,
      `After learning HTML and struggling with CSS, I came up with a brilliant idea of using bootstrap so that I don't have to style everything by myself and - for obvious reasons - if you knew bootstrap, you were cool.`,
      `But now, I'm a legend. I've been coding in JavaScript ,React, NextJS, Firebase, Redux, Node.js, Bootstrap, Tailwind, Material UI, and YouDontKnowShit programming language etc to name a few. Although I barely know the syntax (Stack overflow!), I consider myself a Ninja developer.`,
